cd ~
git clone https://github.com/rrobinett/wsprdaemon.git
cd wsprdaemon
./wsprdaemon.sh -V

I copied a previous wsprdaemon.conf; else follow the instructions in the README
I use WinSCP for this kind of filetransfers
I use Notepad++ for editing as it can be switched from the Windows CR/LF to Linux

./wsprdaemon.sh -V (should be -a but this works as well)
Requesting permission after about 1 1/2 minute of working
after 4 minutes the numpy install takes the most time (7 minutes)
Version = 3.0.6

source ~/wsprdaemon/.wd_bash_aliases
wd-rci
wd-help

And we are on after :
wda
wds
